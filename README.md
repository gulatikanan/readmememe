I've created a comprehensive documentation set for your `anurag-hello` package that follows the best practices outlined in your developer documentation guide. This includes:

1. **Markdown Cheatsheet**: A complete reference for Markdown syntax
2. **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrating the installation and usage flows
3. **Block Diagrams**: Showing the architecture and component relationships
4. **Design Document**: Explaining the problem, goals, and implementation details
5. **MkDocs Configuration**: Ready to use with the Material theme
6. **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of all public functions
7. **Usage Guide**: Examples for both library and CLI usage
8. **Daily Log Template**: For tracking learning progress
9. **Contributing Guidelines**: For potential contributors
10. **Changelog**: To track version history
11. **CLI Commands Reference**: Detailed documentation of all commands
12. **License**: MIT license information

To use this documentation:

1. Create a `docs` directory in your project
2. Copy all the Markdown files into the `docs` directory
3. Copy the `mkdocs.yml` file to your project root
4. Install MkDocs and the Material theme:
   ```
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   ```
5. Run the documentation locally:
   ```
   mkdocs serve
   ```
6. Build the documentation for deployment:
   ```
   mkdocs build
   ```

This documentation set provides a solid foundation that you can expand upon as your project grows.
